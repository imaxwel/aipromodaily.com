#### Offer

**ChatGPT Team for just $1 for the first month (covers up to 5 users).** Official OpenAI promo; great for small teams or friend groups to test business features at minimal cost.

#### Avoid charges

To avoid being charged the regular Team price after the first month, **cancel before 30 days** in your workspace’s billing settings.

#### Quick links

- Claim promotion: **[Get the $1 Team offer](https://chatgpt.com/?promo_campaign=team1dollar#team-pricing)**
- Manage/cancel subscription: **In ChatGPT, click your avatar (top-right) → Manage Workspace → Billing → Manage plan → Cancel subscription.**

#### How to redeem

1. Go to the promo page and log in: **[chatgpt.com/?promo_campaign=team1dollar#team-pricing](https://chatgpt.com/?promo_campaign=team1dollar#team-pricing)**
2. Look for the promotion pop-up on the Team pricing page.
3. Complete checkout—pay **$1 total** for your first month.

#### What’s included

- **Access to advanced models** (as advertised in the promo)
- **Secure team workspace** with admin controls

- **Integrations** with Google Drive, SharePoint, GitHub, and more
- **Business features** suitable for team workflows

#### Availability
